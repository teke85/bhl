            The existing Mutanda to Kaoma road is predominantly gravel, with
            extensive sections requiring urgent upgrades to support heavy-duty
            vehicle transit from the Copperbelt and Northwestern Provinces and
            the DRCâ€™s mining regions. The current state of this road
            infrastructure impedes the efficient movement of goods and people,
            significantly affecting key sectors such as mining and regional
            trade, both of which depend heavily on robust logistics services.
