          The Resettlement Policy Framework emphasizes open and inclusive
          engagement with communities affected by the Mutandaâ€“Kaoma Road
          Project. Consultation is central to the planning and implementation of
          all resettlement and compensation activities.

          BEL-TC works closely with local authorities and community members in
          the <strong>Kalumbila, Kasempa, Mufumbwe, and Kaoma Districts</strong>{" "}
          to ensure that resettlement planning reflects local needs and
          priorities. Engagement activities include information sharing,
          household surveys, and participation in preparing Resettlement Action
          Plans (RAPs).

          Through these consultations, affected persons are informed of their
