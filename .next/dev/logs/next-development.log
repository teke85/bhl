Executed as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), the Western Corridor Limited is the concessionnaire incorporated by BeefCo Limited and First Quantum Minerals (FQM) Limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The groundbreaking ceremony, held in Kasempa, was attended by key Government Officials such as the Minister of Finance and National Planning, Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane, the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Mr. Chipoka Mulenga, the Minister of Infrastructure and Urban Development, Mr. Charles Milupi, the Road Development Agency (RDA) officials, senior government personnel, traditional leaders, private sector partners and members of the electorate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategic Infrastructure Investment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This project is a strategic private sector-led initiative, aligned with the government&#8217;s Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP).

The President emphasized that even when the country was bankrupt, the main priority was to help the people of Zambia through interventions such as the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) to unlock investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a great day because infrastructure, roads in particular, open up investment.
